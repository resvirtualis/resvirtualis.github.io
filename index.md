## About/Research Interests
---
My research work is on machine learning and the specific areas of: generative models with implications for semantics attributes and disentanglement, sensitivity analysis of DL models, fairness/bias in AI, low-shot learning, anomaly detection, adversarial machine learning, and AI privacy. I focus on leading teams and designing AI algorithms that are impactful for applications in healthcare and autonomy.
