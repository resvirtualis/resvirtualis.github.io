## About
---
My work is on algorithmic development for machine intelligence with areas of focus on: generative models, online learning, domain adaptation, low-shot learning, anomaly detection, AI assurance including machine deception, adversarial machine learning, and addressing bias and privacy in AI. I lead teams and design AI algorithms that are impactful for problems in healthcare and robotics.
