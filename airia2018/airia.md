# First workshop on artificial intelligence applied to retinal image analysis 


To be held in conjunction with the 
[Asian Conference on Computer Vision 2018](http://accv2018.net)

Perth, Australia, Sunday December 2, 2018 (afternoon session)
[(WP#9, Level 2 River View
Room 5)](http://accv2018.net/program/#workshops)

 

#CALL FOR PAPERS

### About the workshop

Medical imaging has now embraced AI methods based on deep learning (DL) approaches for medical image analytics. This has been especially true for retinal image analysis where large annotated datasets have been available for over 10 years. Recent studies starting in  2016 have demonstrated on par with human performance for diagnostic tasks such as screening for diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Recently, in 2018, the FDA approved the first software device for retinal diagnostics. The goal of this workshop is to showcase recent developments in retinal image analysis and as a follow up on recent meetings at ARVO 2018 and APTOS 2018, and to bring together practitioners from different horizons that are interested in the development and application of AI and deep learning techniques to retinal imaging, including specialists from machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, ophthalmology, optometry, retinal specialists from academia and industry. While the focus of this workshop is primarily on retinal image analytics, the workshop will also address other main causes of blindness, such as cataract and glaucoma. The workshop will include invited talks as well as oral and poster submissions.

 

### Scope and topics of interest

- automated and semi-automated diagnostics in retinal imaging including for diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), ...


- analysis of other ophthalmic conditions diagnostics (cataract, glaucoma, etc..)

- fine grained severity grading

- datasets and annotations tools and techniques

- validation methods

- deployment to actual clinical scenarios and challenges

- generative methods

- adversarial methods and implications

- teleophthalmology

- multi-modality: OCT, fundus, FAF, hyperspectral, etc..

- hardware and software systems and toolkits for intelligent retinal image analysis
