### First workshop on artificial intelligence applied to retinal image analysis

 

 

#### About the workshop

Medical imaging has now embraced AI methods based on deep learning (DL) approaches for medical image analytics. This has been especially true for retinal image analysis where large annotated datasets have been available for over 10 years. Recent studies starting in  2016 have demonstrated on par with human performance for diagnostic tasks such as screening for diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Recently, in 2018, the FDA approved the first software device for retinal diagnostics. The goal of this workshop is to showcase recent developments in retinal image analysis and as a follow on recent meetings at ARVO 2018 and APTOS 2018, and to bring together practitioners from different horizons that are interested in the development and application of AI and deep learning techniques to retinal imaging, including specialists from machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, ophthalmology, optometry, retinal specialists from academia and industry. While the focus of this workshop is primarily on retinal image analytics, the workshop has also wider interests including looking at other eye diseases such as cataract, and addressing the main causes of blindness including also glaucoma. The workshop will include invited talks as well as oral and poster submissions.

 

#### Objectives and scope

- automated and semi-automated diagnostics in retinal imaging including for DR, AMD, ROP, ...

- other ophthalmic conditions diagnostics (cataract, glaucoma, etc..)

- datasets and annotations

- validation methods

- deployment to actual clinical scenarios and challenges

- generative methods

- adversarial methods and their implications

- teleophthalmology

- multi-modality: OCT, fundus, FAF, hyperspectral, etc..
